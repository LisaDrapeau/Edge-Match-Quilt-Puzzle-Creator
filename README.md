# Edge-Match-Quilt-Puzzle-Creator
A simple interface for designing edge matching puzzles and/or quilt blocks of user selected grid size. Tracks duplicate cell color combinations (regardless of permutation and/or rotation) and color usage. Upon initial load, nothing appears below "Color Usage:" until a quadrant of a cell has been filled in.
